# clustering
This project implements clustering algorithms to analyze synthetic heart disease datasets. Utilizing K-Means, Hierarchical, and Mean Shift clustering techniques, it evaluates performance metrics such as Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.

**Heart Disease Clustering Analysis
This project applies clustering algorithms—K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Mean Shift—to a synthetic heart disease dataset. It also uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure, with a target variable indicating heart disease presence.

Clustering Algorithms:
K-Means: Clusters the data into 3 groups.
Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering: Creates 3 clusters for comparison.
Mean Shift: Dynamically estimates clusters (adjusted with custom bandwidth).

Evaluation Metrics:
Silhouette Score
Calinski-Harabasz Index
Davies-Bouldin Index

Results
Each clustering method is evaluated, with visualizations provided for 2D PCA-reduced data.
