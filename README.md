## **Heart Disease Clustering Analysis**

This project implements **clustering algorithms** to analyze a **synthetic heart disease dataset**. The project applies **K-Means**, **Hierarchical**, and **Mean Shift** clustering techniques and evaluates their performance using the following metrics:  

- **Silhouette Score**
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**

### **Dataset**

The dataset contains medical attributes such as **age**, **cholesterol**, and **blood pressure**, with a **target variable** indicating the presence of **heart disease**.

---

### **Clustering Algorithms Applied**

1. **K-Means**:  
   - Clusters the data into **3 groups**.  

2. **Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering**:  
   - Creates **3 clusters** for comparison.  

3. **Mean Shift**:  
   - Dynamically estimates clusters, with **custom bandwidth adjustment**.

---

### **Evaluation Metrics**

The clustering methods are evaluated based on the following performance metrics:

- **Silhouette Score**: Measures the quality of the clustering.  
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Evaluates the dispersion between clusters.  
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Assesses the average similarity ratio of each cluster.

---

### **Results**

Each clustering method is **evaluated**, and visualizations are provided for the **2D PCA-reduced data**, allowing for an easy comparison of the clustering quality.

This project provides insights into the performance of different clustering algorithms for heart disease data and helps determine the best method for such analyses. ðŸš€
